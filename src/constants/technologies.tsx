        I first started working with React at Qualtrics, through my own study
        and adding to their core products via Hackathons.
        <br />
        <br />
        My primary avenue for developing my React skills has been working on
        personal projects like this one.
        <br />
        <br />
        React has fueled my passion for front-end development, and I am very
        much looking forward to using React more in a professional environment.

        I have worked primarily with Node.js through most of my carrer, in
        varying contexts.
        <br />
        <br />
        All of my personal projects have used Node.js/Express as the primary
        server.
        <br />
        <br />I would like to add Go to my repertoire of backend langauges, but
        have been spending most of my time honing my front-end capabilities.

        The language I have worked with most. However, in recent years I haven't
        been working in pure JS quite as much, as I favor Typescript for most
        projects instead.
        <br />
        <br />
        That bieng said, I'm very happy with how my raw JS skills have improved
        over the years, and I still try to learn new things every day.

        Simply the best. Every personal project of mine uses TypeScript if I can
        help it. Strong typing and better intellisense make it so much easier to
        catch errors before they sneak into production.
        <br />
        <br />I started using TypeScript at Qualtrics before we migrated our
        tests to Python. Sometimes TS can be a pain, but for the most part:
        mmm... I love it.

        Python was the language of choice for the web scraping projects I took
        on as a Economics Research Assistant at BYU, primarily using Selenium.
        <br />
        <br />
        I became much more acquianted with Python when we migrated all of our
        E2E testing at Qualtrics to use Python/Pytest instead of TS/Jest.
        <br />
        <br />I really enjoy using Python, but definitely prefer JS for most of
        my use cases, so I don't use it much on my own.

        I wish I had more here to say about HTML, but we all know what it is.
        I've worked with it for like 6 years and it's mad easy... so enjoy some
        "lorem ipsum"...

        So deceptively tricky, in my opinion. I get that it's straight-forward
        stylesheets, but for someone who was learning the design stuff
        simultaneously, it can be a lot to digest.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even having worked with it for a while, there is still new stuff I
        discover. I've spent time working on my projects and building my React
        component library that CSS and I have become well acquianted, friends
        even -- albiet at arms length through Sass.

        I was in Sass from the beginning of my web development career, but only
        recenly have started using it... and I LOVE IT.
        <br />
        <br />
        Creating variables, mixins, and nesting tags is soooo nice, and has been
        helpful as I try to work on my design chops using CSS.
        <br />
        <br />I have tried using style libraries like bootstrap, but ultimately
        didn't like to surrender the control you get using custom Sass files.
